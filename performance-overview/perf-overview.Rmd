Performance Overview
====================

In order to give a brief intution of the current state of self-optimizing
interpreters compared to other language implementations, we briefly compare 
the performance of a set of classic benchmarks for Java, C, JRuby, and the SOM
implementations.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
