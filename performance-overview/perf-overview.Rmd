Performance Overview
====================

In order to give a brief intution of the current state of self-optimizing
interpreters compared to other language implementations, we briefly compare 
the performance of a set of classic benchmarks for Java, C, JRuby, and the SOM
implementations.

Note, for the moment, the benchmark set is not yet complete for all languages.

**TODO:**
 - Benchmarks:
    - Mandelbrot (represents numerical performance)
    - Delta Blue (represents OO programs)
    - Richards   (represents OO programs)
 - Language Implementations:
    - Java 7, 8, Graal
    - LuaJIT 2
    - PyPy
    - SOM (RTruffleSOM, TruffleSOM, SOM++, CSOM, SOM (java))


Overall Performance
-------------------

As a first, and misleading impression, an aggregated overview over the results
in form of a **TODO** violine plot or box plot:

**TODO**: figure: aggregated results

**TODO**: figure: separated by benchmarks, normalized to fastest Java
